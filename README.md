# AllAboutToysRetailSystem
A University Project - AllAboutToys Ltd. (AAT) have decided to move their brick-and-mortar business online. They believe that expanding to an online presence will widen their customer base and increase their sales. They have produced as set of system specifications for the online system and have contracted you to develop their new toyshop e-retail system in Python.
My role in the group project was to creat function F3 - a shopping basket and order processing system
